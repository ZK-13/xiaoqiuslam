CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 2.8.12 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.


CMake Warning (dev) at /snap/clion/178/bin/cmake/linux/share/cmake-3.21/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (CSPARSE)
  does not match the name of the calling package (CSparse).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  cmake_modules/FindCSparse.cmake:24 (find_package_handle_standard_args)
  CMakeLists.txt:12 (find_package)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
